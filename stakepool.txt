POS Mining Co. is one of this under the radar compagnies, having an already working infrastructure at ICO time : StakePool. As the name might suggest, the project is running an ICO to buy coins to stake with. Token holders already received payouts for October and November, and have see great returns. This is the proof that you don't need over hyped ICO raising millions to perform. And that's why we wanted to interview Lawrence Fisher, the POS Mining Co. CEO.

Hey Lawrence, can you quickly describe Stakepool project ?

How does it differs from other stake project (MASS, Rocket Pool, StakeIt) ? 

So you already have an working infrastructure, could you say some more ?

Ok, is ICO still running ? What is the price of POOL tokens ?

Which coins and masternodes the funds already owns ? Do you have a public sheet of the wallets ?

And for the future, do you have a plan on some coins ?

Do you have a proactive strategy on which coins to buys, sell or is it fully automatic ?

Stakepool had a impressive ROI for now. Do you expect the same for coming monthes ?

Would you like to add any further info?

Thanks Lawrence !
